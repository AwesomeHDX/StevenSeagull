{"name":"Steven Seagull","tagline":"A game created at the Arctic Game Jam, Tromsø","body":"StevenSeagull\r\n=============\r\n\r\nA game created in just 36 hours at the [Arctic Game Jam](http://www.arcticgamejam.com/), Tromsø, 12-14 September 2014\r\n\r\nThe seagull is a cursed were-seagull. In order to turn back into a man, he must pass the curse on to another by connecting with an attack. The attack is a diagonal dive. Seagull moves at constant speed and uses a button to change direction.\r\n\r\nSteven accumulates point by the time he manages to be a man. He can move left and right (and perhaps roll, which is faster).\r\n\r\nIf Seagull’s attack connects, the players change places, with Steven becoming the Seagull and vice versa.\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n----\r\nSound: [@jorgenmathiasolsen](https://github.com/jorgenmathiasolsen)\r\n\r\nArt: [@arnievank](https://github.com/arnievank)\r\n\r\nCode: [@sveinjo](https://github.com/sveinjo) and [@graphiclunarkid](https://github.com/graphiclunarkid)\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\nSteven Seagull is (c) 2014 AwesomeHDX, all rights reserved.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
