                <h1>Steven Seagull</h1>
                <h2>A game created in just 36 hours at the <a href="http://www.arcticgamejam.com/">Arctic Game Jam</a>, Tromsø, 12-14 September 2014</h2>

                <p>Tromsø is being terrorized by a cursed were-seagull. In order to turn back into a man, the seagull must pass the curse on to another by connecting with an attack.</p>
                <p>Steven is walking along the sea-front eating a tasty kebab. He must try to finish his meal while avoiding the seagull's attacks.</p>

                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Player one starts as Seagull; player 2 starts as Steven.</li>
                    <li>Both players move at a fixed speed and can change direction by pressing button 1.</li>
                    <li>Seagull can attack Steven by pressing button 2.</li>
                    <li>Steven can eat his kebab by pressing button 2. While he is eating, his "shish-ke-bar" reduces slowly, and he is more vulnerable to attack.</li>
                    <li>If Seagull’s attack connects, the curse is passed on and the players change places, with Steven becoming Seagull and vice versa.</li>
                    <li>The first player to finish their kebab (as Steven) wins the game.</li>
                </ol>
