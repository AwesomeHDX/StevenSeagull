StevenSeagull
=============

A game created in just 36 hours at the [Arctic Game Jam](http://www.arcticgamejam.com/), Tromsø, 12-14 September 2014

The seagull is a cursed were-seagull. In order to turn back into a man, he must pass the curse on to another by connecting with an attack. The attack is a diagonal dive. Seagull moves at constant speed and uses a button to change direction.

Steven accumulates point by the time he manages to be a man. He can move left and right (and perhaps roll, which is faster).

If Seagull’s attack connects, the players change places, with Steven becoming the Seagull and vice versa.
